# Acid-Base-Calculations
 Tutorial for calculations around acid-base equilibria. Shiny App for titration curves and (log)C pH diagrams.
  
For the time being the tutorial is only available in German. Focus is on. 
* Dissociation of acids
* Calculation of titration diagrams
* Calculation of (log)C pH diagrams 
  
The tutorial is available as R markdown, html, pdf. The tutorial is accompanied by a Shiny app to calculate titration curves and (log)C pH diagrams for acids and bases of up to three dissociation stages. The Shiny app is also accessible under http://exnerkm.shinyapps.io/acid_base_calculator_app
